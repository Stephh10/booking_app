            At AppointDoc, we make healthcare scheduling simple and efficient.
            Our platform helps doctors manage appointments, communicate with
            patients, and optimize their workflow all in one place. By combining
            smart scheduling, automated reminders, and real-time calendar
            integration, we reduce no-shows and save valuable time.
